A rotating cube has two of its faces drawn on in real time. &nbspThe drawing is performed on two 2D canvases on the right of the screen. &nbsp;As the user hovers the mouse from the red canvas to the green canvas etc, the mouse's path appears on the red and green faces of the cube. &nbsp;To provide continuation of the drawing on the cube, the canvas is first rotated in real time... the result of the rotation is displayed near the top left of your screen, and it is actually this rotation that is rendered on the cube.
